- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better development experience
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **CSS3** - Styling and animations

### Chess Engine & AI
- **chess.js** - Chess game logic, move validation, and game state management
- **Custom AI Engine** - Multiple difficulty levels with different evaluation strategies

### UI Components & Styling
- **Lucide React** - Modern icon library for UI elements
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** - Layout and responsive design
- **Custom Components** - Reusable chess piece and board components

### Development Tools
- **ESLint** - Code linting and quality
- **TypeScript Compiler** - Type checking
- **React DevTools** - Development debugging

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### Phase 1: Bot Play Foundation
- ✅ Basic chess board rendering
- ✅ Chess piece representation and display
- ✅ Simple random move AI opponent
- ✅ Move validation using chess.js
- ✅ Turn-based gameplay

### Phase 2: Enhanced AI & Game Logic
- ✅ Multiple AI difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- ✅ Position evaluation algorithms
- ✅ Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- ✅ Advanced move scoring and piece value calculations
- ✅ Strategic position assessment

### Phase 3: Complete Chess Mechanics
- ✅ Full chess rule implementation
- ✅ Special moves (castling, en passant, pawn promotion)
- ✅ Check and checkmate detection
- ✅ Draw conditions (stalemate, insufficient material, 50-move rule)
- ✅ Move history and game state tracking

### Phase 4: User Interface & Experience
- ✅ Interactive drag-and-drop piece movement
- ✅ Click-to-move piece selection
- ✅ Visual move highlights and indicators
- ✅ Game status display (check, checkmate, draw)
- ✅ Move history panel with algebraic notation
- ✅ Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- ✅ Game difficulty selection
- ✅ New game functionality
- ✅ Move animation and smooth transitions
- ✅ Captured pieces display
- ✅ Game timer (optional)
- ✅ Piece promotion dialog

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start a Game**: Select difficulty level and click "New Game"
2. **Make Moves**: 
   - Click a piece to select it
   - Click the destination square to move
   - Or drag and drop pieces
3. **AI Response**: The computer will automatically make its move
4. **Special Moves**: All standard chess moves are supported
5. **Game End**: The game will detect checkmate, stalemate, or draw conditions

## 🤖 AI Difficulty Levels

### Easy
- Random move selection with basic piece safety
- Suitable for beginners
- No deep position analysis

### Medium  
- 2-3 move lookahead
- Basic position evaluation
- Considers piece values and simple tactics

### Hard
- 4-5 move lookahead with alpha-beta pruning
- Advanced position evaluation
- Strategic planning and tactical awareness
